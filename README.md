# Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning: A CNN-LSTM Based Approach

This project uses CNN-LSTM hybrid models to predict stock prices. It includes feature engineering, technical indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD), and evaluation using RMSE and RÂ² score.

## Features
- Real-time data with Yahoo Finance API
- Deep learning: CNN for feature extraction, LSTM for sequence prediction
- Comparison with traditional ML models like SVM and XGBoost
